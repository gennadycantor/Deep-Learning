1) If you have HW that requires coding up a 2,3-layer Neural Network from scratch, do not copy and paste this. This is not complete
and still in progress. Accuracy fluctuates between 70-90. You have been warned. 

2) This NN takes .jpg images as inputs and outputs happy or sad labels per image. <NN>.py does preprocess images for you. However,
make sure you have the  .jpg images in a folder called images. My images are downloaded from FEI face Database. More instructions
in the problem statement.pdf
